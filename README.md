# Credit-Card-Approval-Prediction
This project will test skills related to data analysis, model development, interpreting the results, documentation, and presentation. The task is to analyzing the data, develop multiple models using different techniques, interpret the results, and document the analysis as well as findings.  The data used in this study are simulated and do not correspond to any real accounts.

Detailed tasks to be completed:
1. Preprocessing of Data
2. Analysis of Data
3. Fitting a Logistic Regression Model
4. Developing an additional model (either Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, or Feedforward Neural Network)
5. Interpret and compare the results of each model
6. Describe how can it be used to make dicisions on future credit card applications
7. Do cusotmers who already have an account with the bank receive any favorable treatment in the models? (Support with analysis)
8. How would a person explain to a customer whose application got rejected my a machine?!
